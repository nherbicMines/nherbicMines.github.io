      My technical experience is important, yes.<br><br>But let me tell you a bit about me as a <strong>person</strong>.

      I am roughly 50% outdoorsy Colorado native, and 50% massive nerd. I love to hike, fish, camp, and pretend that I'm good at guitar. When indoors,
      I tend to play videogames or D&D, binge TV shows, and rave about Tolkien to my roommates. Of course when I'm feeling productive I'll work on personal projects (like this website!) that I find interesting.<br><br>I love to create. I don't have a great skill for visual art, so my favorite creations have been games, the synth presented on this website, a cigar-box guitar, and world building related things. This desire to create somewhat fueled my passion for programming, as it's so easy for me to come up with an idea and then make it on the spot and immediately be able to display it to other people. I find that the potential for creation that's been unlocked with modern computing is absolutely incredible, and I'm so happy to have the knowledge and skills to utilize it.
