      <strong>Team Size</strong>: 4
      <br></br>
      <strong>Timeframe</strong>: February 2022-April 2022
      <br></br>
      <strong>Technologies Used</strong>: GameMaker: Studio 2, GML, Github
      <br></br>
      <strong>Description</strong>: Tower Defense: Engineered was a final project for my team's Game Development course.
      It was created in GameMaker: Studio 2 and helped us develop skills for the game creation process as well as
      general team project skills. Much of the work was in our Game Development Document and Github project backlog.
      The concept was a tower-defense style game in which the player has an active role fighting and repairing/upgrading towers
      during enemy waves. The game in its current state only has two levels, with plans to expand at a later date. A mock-trailer for
      the game can be found <a href='./images/Tower-Defense-Engineered.mp4' target='_blank'>here.</a>

      <br></br>
      An evaluation webapp made for RMS-AAPG (Rocky Mountain Section of the American Association of Petroleum Geology).

      <strong>Team Size</strong>: 5
      <br></br>
      <strong>Timeframe</strong>: May 2022-June 2022
      <br></br>
      <strong>Technologies Used</strong>: React, Microsoft Azure Cloud Service, SQL Database, NodeJS, GitHub, Postman
      <br></br>
      <strong>Description</strong>: My team was asked by RMS-AAPG to make a web application which could be used 
      by attendees to evaluate presentations at their annual conference. Through use of an Azure Cloud
      database, it is reusable for every conference they hold. When a properly formatted spreadsheet
      is uploaded, the sections and presentations are repopulated with that year's content. Proper security
      measures were put in place to ensure accurate scores free of abuse. This was my first experience  creating
      a software solution that is actually used by a company. As such, in addition to the software itself, my team
      and I produced a Project Report which can be found <a href='./images/report.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>

      <strong>Team Size</strong>: Solo
      <br></br>
      <strong>Timeframe</strong>: November 2020
      <br></br>
      <strong>Technologies Used</strong>: C++, MS Visual Studio, SFML
      <br></br>
      <strong>Description</strong>: A simple musical synthesizer to challenge myself in combining the science of sound with coding, as well as creating a robust GUI from scratch. It uses a formula to produce a sin wave from the given frequency of the note being pressed. In addition, it has an "alternate mode" which produces a square wave for an 8-bit like sound.
